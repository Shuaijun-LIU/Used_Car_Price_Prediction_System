## Setting Up Your Python Environment

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and importing the required libraries for a Python project. The project uses a variety of libraries for natural language processing, machine learning, and data manipulation.

### Step 1: Installing Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This project requires Python 3.7 or higher.

### Step 2: Creating a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Python projects to avoid conflicts between package versions. You can create a virtual environment using the following commands:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if it's not installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Installing Required Libraries

Once your environment is set up, install the required libraries using `pip`. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal:

```bash
pip install nltk sklearn gensim pandas numpy tensorflow keras
```

This command installs the packages necessary for various project functionalities, including data manipulation, machine learning modeling, and neural network construction.

### Step 4: Downloading Additional NLTK Resources

After installing the NLTK library, you need to download additional resources such as 'wordnet'. You can do this programmatically with the following Python commands:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

### Step 5: Importing Libraries in Your Python Script

In your Python script, you will need to import the installed libraries. Here is how you can import them:

```python
import json
import nltk
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
from gensim.parsing.preprocessing import remove_stopwords
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import KBinsDiscretizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Input
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
```

This setup ensures that all necessary libraries are installed and correctly imported for use in your project scripts.
